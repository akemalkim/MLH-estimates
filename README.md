# Estimation of Mixed Layer Height Using Doppler Lidar

## Project Overview
This project focuses on estimating the mixed layer height (MLH) in the atmosphere using a Doppler lidar instrument. The mixed layer is the part of the atmosphere that is well-mixed due to turbulence and plays a crucial role in various meteorological phenomena, including weather prediction, air quality assessments, and climate studies. By utilizing advanced lidar technology, we aim to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the mixed layer and its implications for atmospheric science.

## Objectives
- To measure the mixed layer height using Doppler lidar data.
- To analyze the effects of atmospheric conditions on the mixed layer dynamics.

## Results
Our analysis has provided key insights into the behavior of the mixed layer:

1. **Doppler Lidar Measurements:** The Doppler lidar instrument allowed for high-resolution profiling of wind velocities and turbulence within the mixed layer.
   - Visualization of wind profiles at various altitudes.
   - Identification of turbulence patterns and their correlation with mixed layer height.

2. **Estimation of Mixed Layer Height:** The estimated mixed layer height was derived from the lidar data, providing a quantitative assessment of how it varies under different atmospheric conditions.

3. **Implications for Atmospheric Studies:** Understanding mixed layer height contributes to improved weather forecasting models and can inform air quality management strategies.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Collected Doppler lidar data from the specified location, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Processed lidar data to remove noise and artifacts, ensuring accuracy in measurements.
   - Implemented algorithms to estimate mixed layer height based on the processed lidar profiles.

3. **Analysis:** Conducted statistical analyses to evaluate the relationships between mixed layer height, atmospheric stability, and other relevant factors.
